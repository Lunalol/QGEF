This two-player game is played over 16 seasonal game rounds, from Summer 1941 through Spring 1945.'),
		totranslate('The game is won by accumulating Victory Points (VPs), most of which will be awarded for controlling geographical objectives during the four annual scoring rounds. If you’re ahead by 10 or more VPs at the end of a scoring round, you win immediately; otherwise, the game continues until the final scoring round, when the player with the most VPs wins.')
